TODO's 5/3/2024

* See comments in "init_webserver()", around web.cpp:240
	-> Revamp / Simplify UI
	-> Home page should only have buttons for "Read Codes" and "Live Data" (Evan's use case)
	-> Maybe reuse original APM live data page?

* Rewrite/port main APM OBD-II library as a static (not a task) library
	-> Evan is working on this, right now there should be functions to poll
	   for supported PIDs but they are untested in an actual vehicle.
	
	-> Evan's idea is to have a function "obd_update()" which the UI task can
	   call whenever to get updated sensor values

	-> Undecided as to how the new lib will handle monitoring PIDs
		
		-> Will "obd_update()" return the new values or just update a shared variable
		
* Right now, there is code for the Web Server task, it's just disabled while I test
  the OBD-II library. I'm still tweaking the UI, just only testing locally.
