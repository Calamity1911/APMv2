TODO's 5/5/2024

* Rewrite/port main APM OBD-II library as a static (not a task) library
	-> Still working on OBD lib, see obd_get_pid()
	-> Maybe use a dictionary like the DTCs to store PIDs
	-> Need to test the PID polling functions

* UI appears to be done in terms of layout, but still need to write the
  javascript to handle the PID/sensor functionality
	-> See the websocket functions from web.cpp lines 176 to 232
	   for both the json formatting and expected response stuff
  
* Also note that the ESP32-S3 dev kits from senior design were actually N8R2 / P2N8
  meaning they only have 8MB Flash and 2MB PSRAM when they were advertised as N16R8.
  Not really a problem though
