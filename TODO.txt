TODO's 5/1/2024

* See comments in "init_webserver()", around web.cpp:240

* Rewrite/port main APM OBD-II library as a static (not a task) library
	-> See around web.cpp:290
	-> Library will store the PIDs being monitored
	-> Maybe a function that takes a struct and places the PID and values into it
	-> Also maybe optimize PID support polling, kinda ugly how main APM does it
	
* Maybe use the "obd_ws" websocket bidirectionally
	-> To send OBD-II reading to the client
	-> To change the values being watched by the client
	-> around web.cpp:177
